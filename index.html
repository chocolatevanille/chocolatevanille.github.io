                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a new graduate from Northwestern University's McCormick 
                    School of Engineering (June 2024). Originally from Washington D.C., my family moved 
                    to Houston, Texas when I was only 3 years old, and we have called it home 
                    ever since.  
                </p>
                <p>I love interating with new and diverse peoples, and value uplifting those around 
                    me in whatever ways I can. When I had time I truly enjoyed running 
                    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@ChocolateVanille" target="_blank">a medium-sized YouTube channel</a>
                    and a slightly larger <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/ChocolateVanille" target="_blank">Twitch</a> 
                    where I met and entertained a variety of amazing people and regularly took part in 
                    or helped manage/host charity events. 
                </p>
                <p>Whatever I do, I put 100% of myself into it. Apparently that's my ADHD but it's 
                    helped me express myself and contribute to the communities I've been part of in 
                    wonderful ways. In September 2019 I became president of Northwestern's Residence 
                    Hall Association (RHA) and organized events that helped make life a little better for my fellow stressed 
                    students. In 2021 I helped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f26btD3Xexo&t=1124s" target="_blank">
                    host</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD7MMWqERqU&t=202s" 
                    target="_blank">provided commentary</a> for the ModernDOOMSpeedrunning 
                    '21 Marathon that raised over $9000(!!) for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. I 
                    worked tech on their '22 Spring Marathon and 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGZzLBehDm0" target="_blank">performed 
                    myself in Slayers4Charity</a>, both raising well over $5k for Save the Children Fund and 
                    Veterans 4 Child Rescue, respectively.

                    These experiences have made me fall in love with teamwork. While I am self-driven 
                    and comfortable operating alone, I am most happy when I get to work with 
                    other passionate people to design new and helpful programs for others. Equipped 
                    with a fresh off the press degree and a variety of practical programming skills, 
                    I'm looking to start a career of doing exactly that.

                <h2>GodmasterHelper</h2>
                <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    This executable allows players of the hit video game Hollow Knight to track their 
                    progress and abilities in the Godmaster DLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Python's class system, I assigned information to each boss in the DLC, such as name, 
                    pantheons, and some numbers data. From there, I designed a UI that would allow for user input 
                    and managed the details of how many times they died to each boss in a way that gave players 
                    info on what they needed to work on to improve. I made sure data could be stored in files and 
                    loaded as needed. Once base functionality was implemented, I designed a full GUI in Python complete 
                    with buttons, drop-down menus, images, pop-up windows, and more, with the goal of enhancing user 
                    experience, particularly in usability. Finally, I exported the program as an executable and 
                    published it on GitHub.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I created an attractive and functional portfolio website using a combination of CSS, HTML,
                    and JS and made it mobile-friendly with variable object sizes and a dropdown menu that replaces the standard navbar when 
                    the screen is too narrow. For usability, that dropdown menu closes upon selecting an option, and on 
                    desktop the current navbar element highlights. I made sure to style unique and beautiful divs and buttons, 
                    the buttons wiping to another background color or expanding on hover. For convenience, images and YouTube videos 
                    are embedded and smooth scrolling implemented. I positioned elements in CSS and HTML with best practices, 
                    and imported icons from FontAwesome.

                    This executable uses an AI ontology to provide ingredient substitutions (based around 
                    food preference and allergens) for a group of meal recipes.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a scalable KRR database in Python, representing shared qualities 
                    of elements via genLs; added elements (represented by isA statements) to the database 
                    and had them inherit genL qualities via backward chaining; and used forward 
                    chaining and reasoning to determine the qualities of ingredients in the recipes.

                <p>
                    Reddit used to rely on moderators to style each individual subreddit, allowing for 
                    a creative and diverse array of forums. From 2016 to 2019 I styled the subreddit 
                    /r/PokemonExchange, a medium sized community which at the time had several thousand 
                    viewers per month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I analyzed CSS elements; injected CSS code to modify tables, links, 
                    headers, menus, lists, and sprites; customized colors; applied hover effects; smoothed 
                    borders; and designed and supported a fully functional dark mode. The CSS has had 
                    changes in banner and wiki images only since 2019, so it is still live!
