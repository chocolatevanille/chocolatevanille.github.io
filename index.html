                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a new graduate from Northwestern University's McCormick 
                    School of Engineering (June 2024). Originally from Washington D.C., my family moved 
                    to Houston, Texas when I was only 3 years old, and we have called it home 
                    ever since.  
                </p>
                <p>I thrive on interacting with diverse groups of people and find joy in uplifting those around me whenever possible. 
                    Beyond academics, I've also cultivated a passion for content creation. Running 
                    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@ChocolateVanille" target="_blank">a medium-sized YouTube 
                    channel</a> and a slightly larger <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/ChocolateVanille" target="_blank">Twitch 
                    stream</a> allowed me to connect with an incredible array of wonderful people and participate 
                    in organizing and hosting charity events—an experience I cherish deeply. Education and now 
                    embarking on my professional career has eroded the time I had to entertain others, but I will never forget the memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Putting my all into everything I do has been a hallmark of my approach. Perhaps should have clued me in 
                    on my ADHD, but paradoxically this limiting element of my brain has fueled my expressiveness, creativity, 
                    and community contributions. At Northwestern, I served as president of the Residence Hall Association 
                    (RHA) from September 2019, organizing events that aimed to alleviate the stresses of student life.
                </p>
                <p>Whatever I do, I put 100% of myself into it. This has 
                    helped me express myself and contribute to the communities I've been part of in 
                    wonderful ways. In September 2019 I became president of Northwestern's Residence 
                    Hall Association (RHA) and organized events that helped make life a little better for my fellow stressed 
                    students. In 2021, I had the privilege of providing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f26btD3Xexo&t=1124s" target="_blank">hosting 
                    services</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD7MMWqERqU&t=202s" target="_blank">commentary</a> 
                    for the ModernDOOMSpeedrunning '21 Marathon, raising over $9,000 for the American Foundation for Suicide 
                    Prevention. Continuing this momentum, I worked tech on the '22 Spring Marathon and 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGZzLBehDm0" target="_blank">participated myself</a> 
                    in Slayers4Charity, raising well over $5000 for Save the Children Fund and Veterans 4 
                    Child Rescue, respectively.

                    These experiences have instilled in me a profound appreciation for teamwork. While I 
                    am adept at working independently, my true passion lies in collaborating with 
                    like-minded individuals to develop innovative and impactful programs for others. 
                    Armed with a fresh degree and a diverse set of practical programming skills, I am 
                    eager to embark on a career dedicated to this mission.

                <h3>Natural Language Processing using PyTorch</h3>
                <p>
                    Ever since YouTube removed the Dislike feature, users have sought alternative ways to gauge community sentiment on videos. 
                    This project aims to fill that gap by analyzing comments to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently in development, the foundational AI engineering is complete. Leveraging Docker, JupyterLab, and 
                    extensive research on PyTorch, I trained a BERT model for sentiment analysis. Using BertForSequenceClassification 
                    from bert-base-uncased, a leading model in NLP, I trained it on 4000 Amazon reviews of movies and TV shows, with 
                    1000 for validation. Achieving acceptable performance metrics—training loss of 0.54 and validation accuracy of 0.707 
                    on the final epoch—I aim to explore larger datasets for improved results.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    This project offered me an opportunity to work hands-on with and learn about the inner systems of AI engineering, such as 
                    tokenizing (special tokens, max length purpose, truncation), input ids (encoding, padding), and attention masks, Pandas.DataFrame, torch 
                    utilities such as DataLoader, Dataset, TensorDataset, RandomSampler, and SequentialSampler, 
                    and practical training elements such as learning rates, optimizing, epochs, schedulers, backwards propagation, loss 
                    calculation, and validation accuracy calculation. This has been a rewarding experience so far. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Moving forward, the next phase involves integrating the YouTube API, allowing users to specify videos for sentiment 
                    analysis based on scraped comments.

                <h3>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) AI in Python</h3>
                <p>
                    Challenged with creating a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) AI solution, I developed an 
                    AI ontology tailored for recommending ingredient substitutions based on food preferences and allergens 
                    within a collection of meal recipes, earning an A in the course.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began by constructing a scalable KRR database in Python, utilizing genLs to represent shared 
                    attributes of elements. Importantly, my approach diverged from simply assigning attributes based 
                    on parent genLs; instead, instances inherited all relevant attributes through backward chaining. 
                    Additionally, the program employed forward chaining and reasoning to deduce ingredient attributes 
                    within recipes and suggest suitable substitutions.

                    report—every task was my responsibility. In instances where team effort was lacking, I

                    This executable enhances the gaming experience for Hollow Knight players by tracking their progress 
                    and abilities in the Godmaster DLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Utilizing Python's class system, I organized information for each boss in the DLC, including names, 
                    pantheons, and numerical data. I then developed a user-friendly UI that allows players to input 
                    their gameplay data, tracking the number of deaths to each boss to provide insights for improvement. 
                    To ensure data persistence, I implemented file storage and retrieval functionalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After establishing core functionality, I expanded the project to include a comprehensive GUI in 
                    Python. This interface features buttons, drop-down menus, images, and pop-up windows designed 
                    to optimize usability and enhance the overall user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The finalized program was exported as an executable and is now available on GitHub for the Hollow 
                    Knight community to utilize and enjoy.

                    Recognizing the limitations of GitHub and aiming to impress potential employers, I took on 
                    the challenge of creating a portfolio website. My primary goal was exceptional usability, 
                    ensuring visitors encounter a functional and intuitive interface. Using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, 
                    I crafted a visually appealing and highly functional website, prioritizing mobile-friendly 
                    design with variable object sizes and a streamlined navigation bar that transitions into an 
                    expandable dropdown menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enhance user experience, the dropdown menu closes automatically upon selection, 
                    maintaining a clean interface. On desktop, the navigation bar highlights the current page 
                    location for easy navigation. I designed unique and aesthetically pleasing divs and buttons, 
                    incorporating personal touches such as a subtle gradient flip effect on buttons, revealed through a 
                    transparent wipe on hover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website features embedded YouTube videos and smooth scrolling for seamless interaction. 
                    For future scalability and flexibility, I adhered to best practices in CSS and HTML for 
                    element positioning, implemented classes liberally, and utilized FontAwesome for

                <h2>r/PokemonExchange CSS</h2>
                <h3>CSS on Reddit!</h3>
                <p>
                    From 2016 to 2019, I served as both head moderator and stylist for the r/PokemonExchange subreddit, 
                    a thriving community with thousands of monthly visitors. This role provided me with the 
                    opportunity to exercise creative control over the subreddit's appearance and functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Partnering with <a href="https://roberto-medina.eu/">Dr. Roberto Medina</a>, we explored various CSS elements to personalize our community. 
                    After analyzing and familiarizing ourselves with CSS fundamentals, we implemented extensive 
                    modifications. Our enhancements included customizing tables, links, headers, menus, lists, and 
                    sprites, integrating hover effects, refining borders, and implementing a fully functional dark mode. 
                    These efforts marked one of my early real-world projects, which I deeply value for the experience gained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our CSS modifications have remained largely unchanged since 2019, with updates limited to banner and 
                    wiki images. The subreddit's customized design is still active today, accessible by replacing 
                    "www" with "old" in the Reddit URL.
