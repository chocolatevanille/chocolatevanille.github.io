                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a new graduate from Northwestern University's McCormick 
                    School of Engineering (June 2024). Originally from Washington D.C., my family moved 
                    to Houston, Texas when I was only 3 years old, and we have called it home 
                    ever since.  
                </p>
                <p>I love interating with new and diverse peoples, and value uplifting those around 
                    me in whatever ways I can. When I had time I truly enjoyed running 
                    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@ChocolateVanille" target="_blank">a medium-sized YouTube channel</a>
                    and a slightly larger <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/ChocolateVanille" target="_blank">Twitch</a> 
                    where I met and entertained a variety of amazing people and regularly took part in 
                    or helped manage/host charity events. 
                </p>
                <p>Whatever I do, I put 100% of myself into it. Apparently that's my ADHD but it's 
                    helped me express myself and contribute to the communities I've been part of in 
                    wonderful ways. In September 2019 I became president of Northwestern's Residence 
                    Hall Association (RHA) and organized events that helped make life a little better for my fellow stressed 
                    students. In 2021 I helped <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f26btD3Xexo&t=1124s" target="_blank">
                    host</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD7MMWqERqU&t=202s" 
                    target="_blank">provided commentary</a> for the ModernDOOMSpeedrunning 
                    '21 Marathon that raised over $9000(!!) for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. I 
                    worked tech on their '22 Spring Marathon and 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGZzLBehDm0" target="_blank">performed 
                    myself in Slayers4Charity</a>, both raising well over $5k for Save the Children Fund and 
                    Veterans 4 Child Rescue, respectively.

                    These experiences have made me fall in love with teamwork. While I am self-driven 
                    and comfortable operating alone, I am most happy when I get to work with 
                    other passionate people to design new and helpful programs for others. Equipped 
                    with a fresh off the press degree and a variety of practical programming skills, 
                    I'm looking to start a career of doing exactly that.

                <h3>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) AI in Python</h3>
                <p>
                    Challenged with crafting a KRR AI solution from scratch for the course Knowledge Representation and 
                    Reasoning, I designed an AI ontology to provide ingredient substitutions (based around food 
                    preference and allergens) for a group of meal recipes, securing an A in the course.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did this by first creating a scalable KRR database in Python, representing shared qualities 
                    of elements via genLs. Critically this program does not simply assign elements the qualities of their 
                    parent genL; instances inherit all appropriate qualities via backward chaining. Likewise the program 
                    employs forward chaining and reasoning to determine the qualities of ingredients in the recipes and 
                    provide appropriate substitutions.

                    Please note: I use "I" here despite this being a group project because I did 
                    all of the work. I do not mean most of the work. I mean literally, all of it. I envisioned the 
                    premise, wrote every line of code (as evidenced by GitHub history), recorded the demo,
                    and wrote the final project report. If the team slacks, I am willing to put in the work.

                <p>
                    This executable allows players of the hit video game Hollow Knight to track their 
                    progress and abilities in the Godmaster DLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Python's class system, I assigned information to each boss in the DLC, such as name, 
                    pantheons, and some numbers data. From there, I designed a UI that would allow for user input 
                    and managed the details of how many times they died to each boss in a way that gave players 
                    info on what they needed to work on to improve. I made sure data could be stored in files and 
                    loaded as needed. Once base functionality was implemented, I designed a full GUI in Python complete 
                    with buttons, drop-down menus, images, pop-up windows, and more, with the goal of enhancing user 
                    experience, particularly in usability. Finally, I exported the program as an executable and 
                    published it on GitHub.

                <p>
                    Faced with the inadequacy of GitHub and a resume to describe myself to potential employers, I 
                    resolved to design a portfolio website. The primary concern was usability; no one 
                    is impressed by a non-functional or confusing website. Therefore, using a combination of CSS, HTML,
                    and JS I set out to make it both attractive and highly functional, with an emphasis on mobile-friendly 
                    design using variable object sizes and transitioning the navigation bar to an expandable dropdown 
                    menu. That dropdown menu closes upon selecting an option, ensuring it doesn't overstay its welcome, and on 
                    desktop the current navbar element highlights to display where the user is on the webpage. I made sure to 
                    style unique and beautiful divs and buttons, including personal touches such as a unique, somewhat transparent 
                    wipe effect that masks a subtle but effective gradient flip on hover. For convenience, YouTube videos 
                    are embedded and smooth scrolling implemented. For scalability and potential changes down the road, I 
                    positioned elements in CSS and HTML with best practices, and imported icons from FontAwesome, a free resource for 
                    many identifiable images and logos.

                <h2>r/PokemonExchange CSS</h2>
                <h3>CSS on Reddit!</h3>
                <p>
                    Reddit used to rely on moderators to style each individual subreddit, allowing for 
                    a creative and diverse array of forums. From 2016 to 2019 I styled the subreddit 
                    r/PokemonExchange, a medium sized community which at the time had several thousand 
                    viewers per month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time I was also the head moderator of the community, so functionally I had creative control. 
                    My partner <a href="https://roberto-medina.eu/">Dr. Roberto Medina</a> and I had fun exploring the different avenues to individualize our 
                    community. We analyzed various elements of the CSS, and once comfortable, began our modifications. 
                    We injected CSS code to modify tables, links, headers, menus, lists, and sprites; customized colors; 
                    applied hover effects; smoothed borders; and designed and supported a fully functional dark mode. This 
                    was one of my first projects out in "the real world", and I'm very thankful for the experience.  
                    The CSS has had changes in banner and wiki images only since 2019, so our creation is still live! Accessing 
                    it requires the "old" prefix in place of "www" when navigating Reddit.
